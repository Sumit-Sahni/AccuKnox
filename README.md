Title: Dashboard
 _____________________________________________
Description:
  A dynamic dashboard application for managing Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) and Cloud Workload Protection Platform (CWPP) widgets. Built with React.js, Redux, and Tailwind CSS, this project demonstrates my 
  ability to create interactive, scalable, and user-friendly web applications.

 Features:
  - Dynamic widget management with real-time updates.
  - Seacrh functionality widget filtering.
  - Responsive design optimized for desktop and mobile devices.
  - Modular and scalable code structure.


  Project Structure
   -  src/components/: Contains reusable React components.
   -  src/store/: Redux store configuration and slices.
   -  src/App.js/: Main application with <Dashboard/>.
   -  src/styles/: Custom styles and Tailwind configuration.


  Challenges and Learning Outcomes
   - Implementing dynamic form rendering based on user input was a challenging aspect of this project. I learned how to leverage Reactâ€™s state management effectively to handle complex UI interactions.
